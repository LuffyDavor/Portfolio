                    <h3>C</h3>
                    <p>
                        I initially learned C as my first programming language during my software development course,
                        which served as my introduction to coding. Although my experience with C was limited to a short
                        period of three weeks during the course, it laid the foundation for my subsequent programming
                        endeavors.

                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>After grasping the fundamentals, I dived into coding with Python. This marked the turning point
                        in my coding journey as my passion for programming grew stronger with each passing day. As a
                        result, I continuously improved my skills and became increasingly proficient in Python.

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        After learning Python, I began exploring Java. I found great joy in coding with Java, especially
                        once I became comfortable with its syntax. Since Java shares similarities with C#, it's still
                        one of my favorite languages to write code in.

                    <h3>C#</h3>
                    <p>
                        C# holds a special place in my heart as my favorite programming language, and I consider myself
                        highly
                        skilled in it. It was the fourth language I learned, and I found great joy in mastering it.
                        Throughout my coding journey, I have utilized C# for various projects, including employing it as
                        the backend language in my web shop project.

                    <p>
                        In the latter part of my course, we delved into HTML and CSS, which provided me with the
                        foundation for web development. This knowledge enabled me to create my portfolio and served as
                        an introduction to the world of web development.

                    <h3>SQL & Databases</h3>
                    <p> I started learning about databases early on in my course and had no trouble using them when
                        necessary. I have experience working with both relational and NoSQL databases, so I am familiar
                        with both types. </p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>MVVM Architecture</h3>
                    <p>While exploring advanced concepts in C#, I came across the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
                        architectural pattern. Intrigued by its potential, I taught myself the pattern and applied it in
                        a small project. Implementing MVVM allowed me to separate the user interface (View), data and
                        logic (Model), and intermediary layer (ViewModel).</p>

                    <h3>Linux & Raspberry Pi</h3>
                    <p>As I learned the basics of Linux, I also experimented with a Raspberry Pi to create a "Magic
                        Mirror." This project involved utilizing the Raspberry Pi's capabilities to build a smart
                        mirror. The Magic Mirror displayed real-time information such as weather updates, calendar
                        events, and news headlines. </p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Javascript + Typescript</h3>
                    <p>During my web development course, I gained proficiency in both JavaScript and TypeScript. I
                        applied JavaScript to develop a Weather App website, while I utilized TypeScript to write the
                        code for my web shop project.
                        These projects allowed me to hone my skills and apply the appropriate language based on the
                        requirements and scope of each project.

                    <h3>React</h3>
                    <p>While working on my web shop project, I took the chance to learn React, and I picked it up
                        quickly. React proved to be a fantastic framework for building the project's user interface.
                        Integrating React was a
                        game-changer, enhancing the user experience and simplifying the development process. I
                        thoroughly enjoyed using React to bring my web shop to life. </p>

                    My Name is Davor and I am 22 years old.
                    I am a Full Stack Junior Developer currently finishing up his Software and Web Development
                    education.
                    My favorite language to code in is "C#", which I am also most skilled at.
                    One of my biggest strengths is the ability to soak up information very quickly and adapt to any new
                    challange I have to face.
                    I am currently looking for a job as a Software or Web Developer, so if you are interested I would
